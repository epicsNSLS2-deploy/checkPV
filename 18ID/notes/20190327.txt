Subject: RE: 18 ID interrupted scan

We did another test in the afternoon with Tom and Xianghui. 

We did series of scans, almost all of them failed at the first 2 or 3 cycles with the same symptom as we saw this morning. 

We checked the file system (list last capturing file) under /NSLS2/xf18id1/DATA/Andor/2019/03/27/. We noticed that during the flyscan has timeout on “XF:18IDB-BI{Det:Neo}HDF1:FileName_RBV”, we can not list the file, it seems the system get some hiccups, the terminal is frozen until it’s timed out after a few mins. This might happen even without flyscan, we still need to find this out. Matt is doing some investigation on that.

Dear All, 

We did some scan test at 18 ID this morning, here is what we found out so far.  

During scan, Bluesky sets “XF:18IDB-BI{Det:Neo}HDF1:FileName” and check the readback value from “XF:18IDB-BI{Det:Neo}HDF1:FileName_RBV”. 
At 11:03:08AM this morning, the monitoring software running on xf18id-srv2 logged about 3 mins lag between the time of the setpoint and readback of this PV “XF:18IDB-BI{Det:Neo}HDF1:FileName”. 

We’re still trying to understand what causes this. 

Please refer to attached file for more detailed information (the last two records).

Meanwhile, is it possible to add more retires/timeout, so that the scan doesn’t abort in this kind of situation?
===============================================
