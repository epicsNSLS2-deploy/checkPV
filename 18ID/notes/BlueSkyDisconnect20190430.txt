Bug: BlueSky/ophyd is trying to doCapture, when we do not have NDArray.
AreaDetector does not allow to acquire.
BlueSky is reporting Timeout error, when it should have reported misconfiguration error, and should have performed the check. As Mark Rivers says, any human would know.
This is a distruction.

ADsimdete.stage_sigs["cam.acquire_period"] = 0.03
adsimdete.stage()  {timed out on HDF1.Caputure_RBV} Check that plugins are primed, otherwise BlueSky is stuck/times-out.
Scientists need to pump image before starting up. Another key word = "warmed up", 
AD issue: Can not Capture/Start, because the dimensions are not known, and must have a 
Can not capture in Single mode, but BS allows staging.
BlueSky TimeStamp is 0, and  arraySize (height=0, width=0, depth=0). NDArray is not pushed up (no dimensions). 
.doCaputer: ERROR must collect an arry to get dimensions first. 

AcquireBusy.PUTF ??? issue in the ioc.

Other detectors: Grasshopper but it runs on Windwos, because linux has issues. Dexela is another detector.

Issue #647. #598
Code branch for "fix_plugin_primed" branch was deleted. This branch might have had the fix.
TimeStamp is changed by the AreaDetector

There is a message in the ioc indicating that dimensions are not set.

When ioc is rebooted, then this must be done.
